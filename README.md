# Daily Programmer Challenge

This repository contains solutions to some problems posted
on [Daily Programmer Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/)

So far I have targeted only _Easy problems_ posted on the subreddit. Ultimately I want to add solutions to all
problems (or as much as I can solve.)

The goal of this code is to solve problem in Java language but, prioritize first on maintainability and readability and
then on performance. I have tried to solve problems without use of any external 3rd party library (so far). You should
be able to easily read the solutions to the problem.

If you do find solutions that could be improved (in readability or maintainability)
or in any other way please raise a PR with your solution.

### Running the solutions

You can run each solution class individually.

> NOTE: You need to enable java `assert` keywords by passing -ea -enableassertions flag to the jvm.
